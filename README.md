# CS790-Assignments
Spring 2025, CS790: Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETS) Assignments

## Assignment 1: The Diamond Shield
This assignment focuses on implementing network firewalls (using pre-made commands and even making a new custom version).

**Note:** The latter part of this assignment is quite challenging and required reading the source code of the library due to acute shortage of documentation.

## Assignment 2: The Evil Eye
This assignment is about making a Wireshark Plugin to detect Tor packets (with minimum errors).

## Assignment 3: Onions: Are they always tasty?
This assignment explores the Tor Circuit Creation algorithm.

**Note:** The first assignment was tougher than the later two.
